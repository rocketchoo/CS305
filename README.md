Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
  Artemis Financial was a company that required assistance in creating a system that was suitable and appropriate to their needs. The company had security issues, hence, they required a program that could help them wihtin that area.
  
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  Before going into a more thorough analysis, I decided that due to the security vulnerabilities that Artemis Financial was facing, I assigned that AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key size would be the best system to provide security for the company. There are a couple of best practice implications that should be integrated such as data confidentiality, integrity, authentication and regular updates. AES can ensure there is robust encryption which protects valuable data from unauthorized data for data confidentiality. It is important to have security, especially within a company, because it ensures that data and information throughout the company is well-protected and secure, hence, there would be less problems regarding the systems of the company. 

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  It was challenging because it was quite complicated to understand at first, but after I understood its purpose, I was able to utilize it, and see how it could impact my evaluation of my assessment. 
  
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I increased levels of security through making sure that the program chosen for the specific company was the best option when it came to protecting the data of the company.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I ran the code multiple times to make sure that there weren't any issues within the code's functionality, and considered every possible issue that could appear. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  I think really understanding the requirements of a project is the most important part when it comes to doing tasks and assignments. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  That I was able to learn a very thorough understanding when it came to coding for security purposes, and that I was able to find the best possible option to the specific requirements given to me.
